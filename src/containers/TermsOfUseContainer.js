          Wallet Use

        <Label fontSize={20} fontFamily="medium">
          The digital asset wallet(s) we provide to you through eckoWALLET (“Wallet”) allow(s) you to store, track, transfer, and manage your balances
          of digital assets. The particular services with respect to any such wallet and supported assets may vary by jurisdiction. You consent to our
          retrieval of private keys or related information, as part of any security protocols we implement, in order to facilitate transfers of
          digital assets, and you acknowledge that this may delay the initiation or crediting of such transfers.
          <br />
          <br />
          Under no circumstances should you attempt to use a Wallet to store, send, request, or receive any assets other than assets that the
          eckoWALLET system supports. We assume no responsibility in connection with any attempt to use a Wallet with digital assets that we do not
          support. When you or a third party sends digital assets to your Wallet from an external wallet, you attest that you are transacting in a
          supported asset that conforms to the particular Wallet address to which funds are directed. You acknowledge and agree that we are not liable
          for any unsupported digital asset that is sent to a Wallet associated with you. We may, in our sole discretion, terminate support for any
          particular digital asset. If you do not sell or send such digital asset off platform before we terminate our support for such digital asset.
          <br />
          <br />
          For purposes of these Terms of Use, supported assets exclude all other protocols and/or functionality which supplement or interact with
          supported assets, unless stated otherwise with respect to a particular supported asset. This exclusion includes but is not limited to:
          metacoins, colored coins, side chains, or other derivative, enhanced, or forked protocols, tokens, or coins or other functionality, such as
          staking, protocol governance, and/or any smart contract functionality, which may supplement or interact with a supported asset. You
          acknowledge and agree that we have no liability for any losses related to supplemental protocols and/or functionalities. You acknowledge and
          accept the risks of operating changes to digital asset protocols and agree that we are not responsible for such operating changes and not
          liable for any loss of value you may experience as a result of such changes in operating rules. You acknowledge and accept that we have sole
          discretion to determine our response to any such operating changes and that we have no responsibility to assist you with unsupported
          currencies or protocols. You further acknowledge and accept that we have no responsibility to support new digital asset forks or operating
          changes for supported assets.
          <br />
          <br />
          All information provided in connection with your access and use of eckoWALLET should not and may not be construed as professional advice.
          You should not take, and should refrain from taking, any action based on any information contained in eckoWALLET, or any other information
          we make available at any time. Before you make any financial, legal or other decisions involving eckoWALLET or use thereof, you should seek
          independent professional advice from an individual who is licensed and qualified in the area for which such advice would be appropriate.
          These Terms of Use are not intended to, and do not, create or impose any fiduciary duties on us. You further agree that the only duties and
          obligations that we have are expressly set out in these Terms of Use (including in the Privacy Policy).

          Custody and Ownership of Digital Assets

        <Label fontSize={20} fontFamily="medium">
          Digital assets held in your Wallet are non-custodial assets.
          <br />
          <br />
          Title to such digital assets shall at all times remain with you and shall not transfer to the Company, except as otherwise provided herein.
          As the owner of such digital assets, you shall bear all risk of loss of such digital assets. We shall have no liability for fluctuations or
          loss in such digital assets. Except as required by law, or except as expressly provided in these Terms of Use, we will not sell, transfer,
          loan, hypothecate, or otherwise alienate such digital assets unless instructed by you. If there are digital assets in your Wallet, and we
          have no record of you accessing eckoWALLET for several years and are unable to contact you, applicable law may require us to deliver any
          such assets to the applicable state or jurisdiction as unclaimed property.
          <br />
          <br />
          You acknowledge that we shall have no obligation to segregate by blockchain address digital assets owned by you from digital assets owned by

          <br />
          <br />

          Instructions from Users
        </Label>
        <Label fontSize={20} fontFamily="medium">
          When you give us instructions with respect to your Wallet, you cannot withdraw such instructions except with respect to any transaction
          associated with such instructions that is to occur on a future date (“Future Transaction”). In the case of a Future Transaction, you may
          withdraw your instructions up until the end of the business day before the date that the Future Transaction is scheduled to take place. When
          we receive instructions for a transaction from your credentials, we will assume that you authorized such transaction, unless you notify us
          otherwise. If you believe you did not authorize a particular transaction or that a transaction was incorrectly carried out, you must contact
          us as soon as possible. It is important that you regularly check your Wallet balances to ensure you notify us as soon as possible of any
          unauthorized or incorrect transactions. Reporting an unauthorized transaction does not guarantee that we will be able to reverse the
          transaction or reimburse you for the transaction. You acknowledge that we cannot execute instructions for transactions for which you do not
          have sufficient digital assets in your Wallet. You further acknowledge and agree that we may cancel or refuse to process any transfer to or
          from your Wallet as required by law or any court or other governmental authority to which we are subject.
          <br />
          <br />
          As an added precaution with respect to transactions, we recommend that users send a small amount of supported assets as a test before
          sending a significant amount of such assets.
